# Users

The **Users** tab of the admin page lists all accounts with their **Username**, **Full Name** and whether they are an
**Administrator**.

![The Users tab](../../images/admin-users.png)

## Adding a user

1. Click **Add User**.
2. Fill in **Username**, **Full Name**, **Password** and **Repeat password**.
3. Check **Administrator** if the user should manage the installation.
4. Click **OK**.

Give the user name and password to the person; they can change the password later themselves (see
[Account & settings](../account.md#changing-the-password)).

!!!warning Always set a password
Marginalia accepts an account with an empty password - anyone can then log in with just the user name. Only do that
on the desktop app on your own computer. Creating a user without a password asks for confirmation first.
!!!

The user name must be unique.

## Editing a user

The pen button opens the same dialog for an existing user:

- change the user name, full name and the administrator flag;
- leave both password fields empty to keep the user's password as it is;
- to set a **new password**, enter it in both password fields;
- to **clear the password**, tick **Clear password** (the password fields are disabled) and confirm. The account then
  has no password.

You don't need the user's current password for any of this. A new or cleared password ends all the user's saved
logins.

### Resetting a forgotten password

Marginalia has no password reset by e-mail. Either:

- set a new password here and tell it to the user, who can change it later with **Change Password**; or
- tick **Clear password**, tell the user to log in with their user name and an **empty** password, and to set a new
  password right away with **Change Password** (leave *Current Password* empty). The administrator never learns the
  new password this way.

!!!warning
Until the user sets a new password, anyone who knows the user name can log in to a cleared account. On a server, clear
the password only when the user can log in right away.
!!!

The last administrator can't lose the administrator flag: *The last administrator cannot be deleted or demoted.*

## Deleting a user

The trash button deletes the account after confirming. You can't delete your own account or the last administrator.

The user can no longer log in, saved logins on their devices stop working, and the user name becomes free for a new
account.

Their books, lorebooks, inference providers (with their API keys), protocols, tags and settings disappear with the
account - nobody can see them any more - and the next [Cleanup](cleanup.md) removes them from the database together
with the account.

The user's files (uploaded images and resources) are kept: their folder in the data directory is renamed to
`<login>-deleted` (`<login>-deleted-2`... if that name is taken), so a new account with the same user name starts with
an empty folder. Delete the renamed folder by hand once you don't need it.
