"""
Finds developer documentation pages that may be out of date.

Every page in manual/developer/ has two front matter keys:

    verified: b244ca1          the commit the page was last checked against the code
    covers:                    the code the page describes (files or folders, relative to the repository root)
      - marginalia/src/main/resources/migration

The script lists, for each page, the covered files that changed between `verified` and HEAD.

    python3 tools/check_dev_docs.py                  # report: added / deleted files by name, modified ones counted
    python3 tools/check_dev_docs.py -v               # also name the modified files
    python3 tools/check_dev_docs.py --check          # same report, exit code 1 when any page is behind (for CI)
    python3 tools/check_dev_docs.py --stamp database.md plugins/overview.md
                                                     # mark pages as verified at HEAD (after you reviewed them)
    python3 tools/check_dev_docs.py --stamp-all      # ... all pages

A page is only as good as its `covers` list: when a page starts describing other code, add the path there. Stamp pages
in a commit of their own after the review - the stamp is the commit that was checked, so it can't name the commit
that contains it. Uncommitted changes are not seen, commit first.
