/**
 * The way an {@link com.github.enerccio.marginalia.domain.traits.LLMFunction} method answers. Every such method takes
 * one as its first parameter (the model does not see it) and returns {@code void}: the method is called on a thread of
 * its own, may hand the work to anything else and finishes the call, from any thread and at any time, by calling
 * exactly one of {@link #complete} or {@link #fail}. The model is asked again only after that. The first finish wins,
 * later ones are ignored.

 * }

 * @param <T> what the function answers: a string is sent to the model as it is, anything else as JSON
