/**
 * Describes a field of a class the model answers with, see
 * {@code InferenceService.infer(payload, protocol, Class, callback)}: the constraints go into the JSON schema, the
 * answer is checked against it before it is deserialized. Put it on the field, the getter or the component of a record.
 * Optional: a field without it is required and has no constraints. The property is named as the Java field (or
 * {@code @JsonProperty}).
 * <p>
 * The limits are ignored when they keep their default; the ones that don't fit the type of the field (a
 * {@code minLength} of a number) are ignored too.
