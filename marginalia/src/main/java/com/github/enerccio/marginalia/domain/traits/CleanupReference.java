/**
 * Describes how a reference between entities behaves during cleanup of soft deleted objects.
 * <p>
 * JPA associations (ManyToOne, OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany) are discovered from hibernate metamodel automatically
 * and default to {@link Policy#STRONG}, annotation is only needed to change the policy.
 * <p>
 * Non association fields holding ids of other entities (soft references) must be annotated with either
 * {@link #target()} or {@link #targetClassField()} to be discovered. Soft reference can be either persistent column
 * or {@link ExtendedAttribute}.
 * <p>
 * When placed on entity class, {@link #field()} names inherited field (ie from mapped superclass) the policy applies to.
